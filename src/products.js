It is mainly used on the surface of resin products. It is a continuous thin layer and the  function of the gel coat resin on the surface of the product is to provide a protective layer for the base resin or laminate to improve the weather. It adds some extra shine and finishing to the products. Gelcoat is applied as the first layer on the negative mold. It therefore serves as the base layer. The glass fiber fabric is then laid on top of this and shaped to meet the requirements. Gelcoat not only serves as a base layer but also as an adhesive: it hardens sticky on the side facing the air so that the application of the fiber is straightforward. Gelcoat resin coated surface is glossy after cured. It has good mechanical properties and water resistance and is resistance to mild chemicals and ultra-violet light, thus enhancing the durability of glassfibre reinforced plastics (GRP) products These resins are tailor made to meet the diverse needs of GRP/FRP industry and meeting the requirements of customers interest of improved efficiency and superior performance of finished product.",

Their disadvantage lies in toxicity levels. Halogen-free FR are a “greener” type of resin that produces less toxicity and less smoke. They also are less corrosive to application equipment and as a result, easier to handle with a wider variety of tools. The main halogenated FR resins are brominated and chlorinated, whereas halogen-free FR resins contain metal hydroxides, melamine-based and phosphorous based FR’s. Halogenated epoxy vinyl esters and polyesters also exist on the market. The type of FR resin system used will depend on the function of the polymer and the specific fire performance requirements. Ashtrays and cookware are some examples of the use of polymers with high fire resistance. Many components in electrical and electronic components are also made with the use for FR polymers. Other uses can include transportation components, building panels, water treatment plant equipment, ducting, roofing and equipment exposed to high temperatures. ",

        "desc": "CSM mat is made of randomly oriented chopped glass strands bonded together in mat form using an emulsion binder. The emulsion binder uniquely bonds the mat so that it conforms rapidly to highly contoured moulds. It is a porous, well bonded mat which maintains its integrity during the impregnation process and provides an uniform wet-through rate. The emulsion binder produces superior handling properties compared to powder bonded mats. CSM mat is a reinforcement for use with unsaturated polyester resins in the hand lay-up process. Ideal for applications such as auto parts, boats, chemical tanks and swimming pools. Typical applications are those which require a high glass content and good mechanical properties. CSM is ideal in applications requiring rapid impregnation and excellent wetting. CSM has excellent handling and tailoring properties as well as the ability to conform rapidly to even the most complex moulds.",

WR glass satisfies the requirements and description of both E-Glass and E-CR Glass according to ISO 2078 and ASTM D578. WR is composed of direct rovings woven into a fabric or tape. The input rovings are designed to give controlled wet-out and excellent laminate properties. The construction gives bi-directional (0°/90°) reinforcement and the strength of continuous filaments. Woven Roving Fabrics are designed to be compatible with multiple resin systems, and can be customized to meet specific product requirement.",

It is widely used in vulcanization (crosslinking) of polymers. It is derived from the reaction of methyl ethyl ketone and hydrogen peroxide under acidic conditions. Several products result from this reaction including a cyclic dimer. The linear dimer, the topic of this article, is the most prevalent and this is the form that is typically quoted in the commercially available material. Solutions of 30 to 40% MEKP are used in industry and by hobbyists as catalyst to initiate the crosslinking of unsaturated polyester resins used in fiberglass, and casting.",
