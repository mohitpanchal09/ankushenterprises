It is mainly used on the surface of resin products. It is a continuous thin layer and the  function of the gel coat resin on the surface of the product is to provide a protective layer for the base resin or laminate to improve the weather. It adds some extra shine and finishing to the products. Gelcoat is applied as the first layer on the negative mold. It therefore serves as the base layer. The glass fiber fabric is then laid on top of this and shaped to meet the requirements. Gelcoat not only serves as a base layer but also as an adhesive: it hardens sticky on the side facing the air so that the application of the fiber is straightforward. Gelcoat resin coated surface is glossy after cured. It has good mechanical properties and water resistance and is resistance to mild chemicals and ultra-violet light, thus enhancing the durability of glassfibre reinforced plastics (GRP) products These resins are tailor make to meet the diverse needs of GRP/FRP industry and meeting the requirements of customers interest of improved efficiency and superior performance of finished product.",

Their disadvantage lies in toxicity levels. Halogen-free FR are a “greener” type of resin that produces less toxicity and less smoke. They also are less corrosive to application equipment and as a result, easier to handle with a wider variety of tools. The main halogenated FR resins are brominated and chlorinated, whereas halogen-free FR resins contain metal hydroxides, melamine-based and phosphorous based FR’s. Halogenated epoxy vinyl esters and polyesters also exist on the market. The type of FR resin system used will depend on the function of the polymer and the specific fire performance requirements. Ashtrays and cookware are some examples of the use of polymers with high fire resistance. Many components in electrical and electronic components are also made with the use for FR polymers. Other uses can include transportation components, building panels, water treatment plant equipment, ducting, roofing and equipment exposed to high temperatures. ",
